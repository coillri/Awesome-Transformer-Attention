Suggesstions / paper updates / any contributions to this list are most welcome! 

Please feel free to *create pull requests* as follows: <br> 

Modify the README.md and follow the format: 
``` 
* **Abbreviation**: "Paper title", Conference/Journal, Year (*Company/School*). [[Paper](link)] [[Code](link)] [[Website](link)]
``` 

For example:
* **3DETR**: "An End-to-End Transformer Model for 3D Object Detection", ICCV, 2021 (*Facebook*). [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08141)][[PyTorch](https://github.com/facebookresearch/3detr)][[Website](https://facebookresearch.github.io/3detr/)]

Notes:
1. Please insert the paper under the most related category.
2. If there is no abbreviation, just use "?".
3. For the paper link, links to abstract are more preferred than links to PDF files to avoid long loading time.
4. If the platform of the code is known, it is preferred to directly write it (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.)
5. If there are other types of links (e.g., slides, video, etc.), feel free to add them :)
